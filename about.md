My passion is working with small teams of developers to build open source software products.
Through out my career, I have done this continually in different programming languages, environments, corporations, universities, startups, and teaching. Success can be defined in many ways, but most importantly I define it as being totally fulfilled in my professional life by helping other people work together as a team.

Business acumen comes via deeply understanding how other skilled people and companies accomplish the task of building superior software products that people want to use.  The team building effort is a function of matching each personâ€™s strengths with the job they have to perform.

My vision of life is all about a daily practice of making progress each and every day which over time builds to long term results and learning.  I view the companies I work for in that same light.  It takes years to build a successful company, and fortunately you are never done with the task at hand.  Incredible patience and focus are the ingredients that enable one to continue to hone the message and product that the company is marketing to their customer.

I practice these skills each and every day in my life and it translates across to my personal life as well.  I love teaching English to native Spanish speakers, and I have done so in the past while living in South America for extended periods of time both in Ecuador and Argentina.

In 2003, I founded Arcadian Group with the primary focus of giving something back to society. Since that time I have worked on several major projects which I would call contributions. One of them being a Science and Math Charter High School for students in grades 9 through 12 which was opened in Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2005 with $400,000 of support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through their High Tech High Initiative. I co-founded the school with Mayor Martin Chavez and Robin Troup an educator.
