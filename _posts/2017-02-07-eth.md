Since early 2016 I have been working on blockchain technology in relation to
the **[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)** platform concentrating on the core
pieces of the code that allow people to build distributed technologies not necessarily
related to the blockchain.  Examples of this include:

* [Swarm](http://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/swarm#the-thsph-orange-paper-series)
* [Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper)

These are Ethereum projects that are building out long term infrastructures to
accomplish different tasks.

The basis for these programs and data structures include the following components.

#### Common

All of the Ethereum projects have access to the common infrastructure pieces
including hex utilities, manipulating of numbers between signed and unsigned ints
and many other functions found in the
[common](https://godoc.org/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common) package.

#### Crypto

At the core of Ethereum is **Cryptography**.  The
[crypto](https://godoc.org/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto)
package is used throughout every application.  Mission critical to setting
up an Ethereum based application is to start off with a P2P handshake.  It comes
in 2 parts.  Part one is the encryption handshake and part two is the protocol handshake
as outlined in the P2P package server function named setupConn.

#### Event

Event is Ethereum's simple built in homegrown Pub / Sub system which is pretty nice
and allows one to publish and subscribe to events on channels.  It is an abstraction
layer above Go's core channel infrastructure.

#### P2P

The P2P system is what makes Ethereum tick.  Every aspect of Ethereum is based
on a distributed set of peers that reside all over the world and communicate
seamlessly which one another.  A separate post on this topic will outline many
of the details associated with the P2P system.

#### RLP

The RLP System, meaning Recursive Length Prefix, is the main way of encoding data
in Ethereum.  There are many different ways to encode data in Go including:

* [GOB](https://godoc.org/encoding/gob)
* [MessagePack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack)
* [Codec](https://github.com/ugorji/go/blob/master/codec/README.md)

And Ethereum has chosen to roll their own format which works fine, is compact,
and is everywhere in their software.
