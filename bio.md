Michael Angerman is a computer scientist who has actively been involved in the academic and business worlds all his professional life. The ability to move between both arenas throughout his career has given him the unique perspective needed to understand what it takes to make both tick.

He is intimately familiar with the inner workings of business and management from various angles. He was the tenth employee at Vitria Technology and helped grow the company to over 1200 employees in five years and was actively involved in all facets of the business from sales to marketing to software development. Also, along with his boss, helped grow Sun Microsystems Java Consulting practice from two employees to fifty employees in one year.

He has been actively involved in the financial markets since 1989 when he arrived at the Santa Fe Institute. He met many people who inspired him to apply computational models to the world of finance. During his tenure at SFI, he wrote many different computer programs based on fractal geometry, chaos theory, and neural networks to simulate the way financial markets work. While living in Santa Fe he took a sabbatical from SFI and moved to Chicago to work for a trading firm with seats on the major Chicago exchanges trading the currencies and the metals.

His main focus is in the equity markets where he concentrates much of his time understanding the free cash flow metric as a way to better understand how companies operate. He enjoys pouring over 10K's, 10Q's, and corporate web sites to better understand the facets that drives successful corporations. Because of his background in the financial world, he understands intuitively what makes a business grow, profit, and flourish.

In 2003, Michael founded Arcadian Group with the primary focus of giving something back to society. Since that time he has worked on two major projects which he would call contributions. A Science and Math Charter High School for students in grades 9 through 12 was opened in Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2005 with $400,000 of support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through their High Tech High Initiative. Michael co-founded the school with Mayor Martin Chavez and Robin Troup an educator. In 2008, Michael and a friend of his traveled to Ecuador where they taught English to local people who were striving to improve their language skills. Since that time, he has been very passionate about the Spanish language and the native peoples of Latin America.
